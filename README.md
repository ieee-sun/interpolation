## [Basic] - Linear Interpolation
Linear interpolation is a simple and effective method for estimating missing values when the data is relatively smooth, and **exhibits linear trends** between data points.

## [Advanced] - Curved Interpolation:
- ### Polynomial Interpolation
  Polynomial interpolation fits a polynomial of specified order, or **complex curves** through the known data points, making it suitable for datasets with non-linear trends.
- ### Spline Interpolation
  Spline interpolation fits **piecewise polynomials** between data points, ensuring smooth transitions. It effectively captures **complex patterns** without the risk of overfitting.

## Dealing with Seasonal Data:
- ### Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series
- ### Filling Missing Values Using Seasonal Decomposition
  Seasonal decomposition is highly effective for **time series data** with clear seasonal patterns. It separates the data into `trend`, `seasonal`, and `residual` components, allowing for targeted imputation. Filling missing values using the `trend` component can be effective in **seasonal data**.

## Machine Learning for Imputation:
- ### Using K-Nearest Neighbors to Impute Missing Values
  KNN imputation is a versatile method that **estimates missing values based on the similarity to other data points**. It can capture local patterns in the data.
